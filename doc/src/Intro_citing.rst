Citing LAMMPS
-------------

Core Algorithms
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Since LAMMPS is a community project, there is not a single one
publication or reference that describes **all** of LAMMPS.
The canonical publication that describes the foundation, that is
the basic spatial decomposition approach, the neighbor finding,
and basic communications algorithms used in LAMMPS is:

 `S. Plimpton, Fast Parallel Algorithms for Short-Range Molecular Dynamics, J Comp Phys, 117, 1-19 (1995). <http://www.sandia.gov/~sjplimp/papers/jcompphys95.pdf>`_

So any project using LAMMPS (or a derivative application using LAMMPS as
a simulation engine) should cite this paper. A new publication
describing the developments and improvements of LAMMPS in the 25 years
since then is currently in preparation.


DOI for the LAMMPS code
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

LAMMPS developers use the `Zenodo service at CERN
<https://zenodo.org/>`_ to create digital object identifies (DOI) for
stable releases of the LAMMPS code. There are two types of DOIs for the
LAMMPS source code: 1) the canonical DOI for **all** versions of LAMMPS,
which will always point to the latest stable release version is:

  `DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.3726416 <https://dx.doi/org/10.5281/zenodo.3726416>`_

In addition there are DOIs for individual stable releases starting with
the `3 March 2020 version, DOI:10.5281/zenodo.3726417 <https://dx.doi/org/10.5281/zenodo.3726416>`_


Home page
^^^^^^^^^

The LAMMPS website at `https://lammps.sandia.gov/ <https://lammps.sandia.gov>`_ is the canonical
location for information about LAMMPS and more detailed lists of publications
using LAMMPS and contributing features.

Citing contributions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

LAMMPS has many features and uses previously published methods and
algorithms or novel features. It also includes potential parameter
filed for specific models.  You can look up relevant publications either
in the LAMMPS output to the screen, the ``log.cite`` file (which is
populated with references to relevant papers through embedding them into
the source code) and in the documentation of the :doc:`corresponding commands
<Commands_all>` or in the :doc:`Howto tutorials <Howto>`.
